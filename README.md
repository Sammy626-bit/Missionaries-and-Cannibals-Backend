# Missionaries-and-Cannibals-Backend
Welcome to the Missionaries and Cannibals game! This project is an implementation of the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem in Python. The game challenges players to transport missionaries and cannibals across a river using a boat, adhering to certain constraints to avoid losing the game.
